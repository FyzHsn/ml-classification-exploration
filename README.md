# A Broad Exploration of ML Techniques
Machine learning, as a field, has been evolving rapidly. While the popularity of packages such as scikit-learn has been stable, distributed and cloud computing software such as Apache Spark has become crucial for the handling of big data and training complex models. Part of my motivation behind the work presented here is to develop a broad ML tech stack. The main themes are:

1. scikit-learn: stochastic gradient descent, logistic regression, imblearn, Google Compute Engine
2. PySpark: MlLib, Google Cloud Compute Engine, Dataproc
3. PyTorch
4. TensorFlow
5. Julia
